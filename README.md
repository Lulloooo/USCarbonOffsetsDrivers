# Carbon offsets in US cap and trade market: a thorough analysis of its drivers and its effects on allowance prices

## 📝 Abstract
Carbon offset credits are claimed to be one of the most cost-effective methods to effectively decrease emissions in carbon markets. As a consequence, the number of offset credits surrendered for compliance within the US has seen a constant increase. The raising interest for offsets among capped entities, however, was not shared between all the US regional cap and trade markets and sectors. 
Employing a mixed approach this study discusses the main drivers that influence offsets usage both at the market and sectoral level in California cap and trade and RGGI. Moreover, through an ARDL model, it tests whether offset usage and availability have a significant effect on allowances price within the California cap and trade system.
In line with what was expected, several market features influence the use of offsets. Amongst those, the main ones are quantitative limits, allowances prices, cap stringency and qualitative limits. Instead, sectoral characteristics that affect offset use are emissions intensity and the cost of abatement. Finally, offsets supply and offsets in California general account are statically significant in determining allowances price.
